Dear Professor Smith
    On behalf of the Talents English Speech Contest Committee, I'm writing to invite you to be our new judge 
    As the core of our Foreign Culture Festival. This school-wide contest is to be held in the students auditorium on May 12(next Sunday) and we believe that you can give our competitors some enlightening comments as both a native English speaker and a knowledgeable professor. Specifically, the event will start at around 7p.m. and last for two hours at most. At the end of it, we will have some handmade presents for each judge and competitor. 
    Once again, we sincerely hope you can be the judge for our competition. 

Yours sincerely, Li Ming.
