Dear Bob,
    I have just arrived at my home from the airport. As I sit down at my desk, I just want to write a letter to you to thank you for your warm reception in the culturl exchange program. You and your family left a deep impression upon me. Indeed, the program is one of the most wonderful memories in my life.
    I remember you metioned wanting to travel in China. Well, if you come to China, You will be warmly welcomed, and it will be my pleasure to be your guide here. If you would like, send me a list beforehand of the places you would like to visit.
    Please give my best regards to your family.
                        Yours,
                    Zhang Wei
