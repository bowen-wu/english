You may be tightly bound by daily classes, abundant homework and frequent exams. Thus, be prepared for the hectic life here.

So, enjoy your life in this esteemed institute!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be worthwhile and enhance your whole life. Hope you like it here.<br>

Dear Sir or Madam,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I bought an electronic dictionary from your online shore on January 1st, but after using it for a short period of time, I found it has some problems.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. You help is greatly appreciated.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely</p>

Dear Professor Cook,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are greatly honored to welcome you as a guest professor at our university. I would like to recommend two scenic spots in our city: the Palace Museum and the Great Wall.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The primary reasons are as follows. To begin with, the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, was the imperial(皇帝的) palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is also the largest piece of ancient Chinese architecture currently existing. MeanWhile, the Great Wall, symbolizing China's ancient civilization, is one of the world's most renowned projects. As the great creation of the ancient Chinese people and one of the wonders of the world, it was listed as one of the world cultural heritage sites in 1987.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope you will have the opportunity to visit one or both of these spots. We wish you enjoy your stay in our city.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>
