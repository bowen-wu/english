Dear Sir or Madam,
    I bought an electronic dictionary from your online shore on January 1st, but after using it for a short period of time, I found it has some problems.
    To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.
    Therefore, I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. You help is greatly appreciated.
